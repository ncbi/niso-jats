The four files in this directory are a DRAFT application of the 
Article Authoring Tag Set described in version 0.4 of NISO Z39.96 
"JATS: Journal Article Tag Suite".

Version 0.4 of Z39.96 is a "Draft Standard for Trial Use" released 
March 30, 2011 with a 6-month comment period to end September 30,
2011. All comments will be answered by the JATS Working Group, and 
version 1.0 will be released. 

There may be significant changes to the Tag Suite or to the individual
Tag Sets between this draft version and the final version. We do not 
guarantee that version 1.0 will be backward-compatible with this 
draft version. Please consider this as you start developing with 
these files.
