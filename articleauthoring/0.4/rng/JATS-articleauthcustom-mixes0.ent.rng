<!--
  
  Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
  
       =============================================================
       Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)
  
       =============================================================
       Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
  
       This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
       The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
       Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
       becomes a NISO standard. Thus, NLM "Version 3.1 Draft" has 
       been changed to NISO "Version 0.4". No model, attribute, or
       parameter entity changes were made as part of this renaming.
  
       Details on NISO Tial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
  
    3. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131//EN", 
       modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
       and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
       new version number "0".
  
       =============================================================
       Version 3.1                       (DAL/BTU) v3.1 (2010-04-30)
  
       Version 3.1 is fully compatible with Version 3.0.
  
       Details on version 3.1 are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/3.1.
  
    2. Updated public identifier to "v3.1 20100830//EN"
  
       =============================================================
       Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)
  
       Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
       In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
       elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
       to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
       All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
       web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.
  
       Details on version 3.0 are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.
  
    1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20080202//EN"

<!-- BLOCK MIXES FOR USE IN CONTENT MODELS -->

<!-- PARAGRAPH-LEVEL ELEMENTS -->
<!--
  Elements that may be used at the same
  structural level as a paragraph, for
  example inside a Section
  Note: There a major overlap between this
  parameter entity and that for the elements
  that are at the same level as a paragraph.
  Inline elements appear only inside a
  paragraph, but block elements such as quotes
  and lists may appear either within a
  paragraph or at the same level as a
  paragraph. This serves a requirement in a
  repository DTD, since some incoming material
  will have restricted such elements to only
  inside a paragraph,  some incoming material
  will have restricted them to only outside a
  paragraph and some may allow them in both
  places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
  be in either or both.

    subscript and superscript by some, more
    restrictive DTDs.
    MAINTENANCE NOTE: This Parameter Entity

    and some have been set to #PCDATA plus the
    other in an effort to allow designers to
    modify entire groups of elements, but not
    to change similar models individually .
