Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
   
     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, NLM "Version 3.1 Draft" has 
     been changed to NISO "Version 0.4". No model, attribute, or
     parameter entity changes were made as part of this renaming.
   
     Details on NISO Tial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
 10. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131//EN", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

     =============================================================
     Version 3.1                       (DAL/BTU) v3.1 (2010-04-30)

     Version 3.1 is fully compatible with Version 3.0.

     Details on version 3.1 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/3.1.

  9. XREF ATTRIBUTES - Removed the %xref-atts PE from this module
     since the regular version (in xlink3.ent) was equally inclusive.

  8. ISSUE - Allowed to repeat inside <article-meta>

  7. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
     to <article-meta> through %article meta-model;. This element
     will hold multiple <aff>s that are a representation of a
     single affiliation, for example, the name of an institution
     in two languages or two scripts.

  6. PERSON-GROUP - Became a mixed-content model, so the parameter
     entity %person-group-model: was changed to
     %person-group-elements;, which will be mixed with #PCDATA
     as defined in references.ent. The PE person-group-model has
     been retained in references.ent for compatibility, but has been
     set to the mixed model using person-group-elements.

  5. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to %display-atts;. Also added these attributes
     to the following over-rides:
      - article-id through article-id-atts (@specific-user only)
      - award-id through award-id-atts (both)
      - date through date-atts (@specific-use only)
      - funding-statement through funding-statement-atts (both)
      - pub-id through pub-id-atts (@specific-use only)
      - trans-title through pub-id-atts (@specific-use only;
         @xml:lang already)
      - xref through xref-atts (both)

  3. STRING-DATE - Added <string-date> back to the following
     elements using %citation-additions.class;. It was accidentally
     deleted during the 3.0 revision of references.class:
      - product         (%product-elements;)
      - related-article (%related-article-elements;)
      - related-object  (%related-object-elements;)
      - funding-statement through funding-statement-atts (both)

  2. Updated public identifier to "v3.1 20100830//EN"

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.
