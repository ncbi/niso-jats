     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, NLM "Version 3.1 Draft" has 
     been changed to NISO "Version 0.4". No model, attribute, or
     parameter entity changes were made as part of this renaming.
   
     Details on NISO Tial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  3. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131//EN", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

     =============================================================
     Version 3.1                       (DAL/BTU) v3.1 (2010-04-30)

     Version 3.1 is fully compatible with Version 3.0.

     Details on version 3.1 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/3.1.

  2. Updated public identifier to "v3.1 20100830//EN"

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

                        paragraph or at the same level as a
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material
                        will have restricted such elements to only

                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
